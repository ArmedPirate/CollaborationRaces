## Ghoul

You are a sentient ghoul. Your origins may be unknown to you. All that is certain is that every ghoul is driven by a desire to quench an unquenchable hunger. You struggle to tame this hunger and continue your purpose from life. 

Most ghouls turn their hunger into a tool, becoming mercenaries, soldiers or assassins. Few others turn away from their fate, fighting to better their undying curse and rebuke their own evils.
