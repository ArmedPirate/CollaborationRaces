## Popular Races to Design

Just a list of ideas for when inspiration strikes or you have 15 minutes and are reading the MM. Consider what players have asked you if they could play, what races are popular on Reddit/Discord/Giant in the Playground/Twitch, etc. Pair with popular tropes of wide ranging fantasy settings such as Game of Thrones, LotR, Magic the Gatherings worlds, etc. Common races between these and DnD classic settings are great jumping off points.
