# Races of the Jungle

##### Races for Exploring High-Fantasy Jungles in the World's Greatest Roleplaying Game

The air  is thick and muggy. The insects stick to your skin, biting and sucking at your open wounds. You've been traveling for days, weeks, maybe months, you can't remember. All you know is you've put your faith and coin in the stout frog-man before you to take you where you most desire. 

One misstep and you are flung into the air, hanging by one leg by a snare. From the foliage a band of skinks let out a volley of blowgun needles, piercing your worn flesh and knocking you unconscious with their poisons.

You awake to the sight of a burning flame before you. Hissing voices echo and chant around you. As your eyes begin to adjust and the haze fades, you see yourself surrounded and bound above a fire pit. Serpent creatures chant in tongues, eager for the sacrifice to their hungering deity. 

The feral creatures of the jungle are often seen as hostile enemies that only desire your head. This is not always true; many seek coin and adventure like any other hero and offer a valuable service to those seeking their fortune. 

This brief guide offers rules for playing as common jungle races such as Bullywugs and Grungs while addressing some existing races and tweaking them to offer a variance to existing ways to play characters in a jungle environment.

# New Races
##### Bullywugs and Grung, Half-Fey, Saurials and Vegepygmies 
The following are three unique races commonly found in jungle settings. 

## Bullywugs and Grung
The frog-folk are two groups of humanoids that live within different ecosystems. Despite sharing some similar biological traits, these two cousins differ greatly in philosophy and lifestyle.

Some abandon their tribal lives and sell their expertise to adventurers. Those who find adventurers inspiring seek to emulate themselves and even reach the status of hero through dedication and progression. Most frog-folk still struglle to fit in with the majority of humanoid races. Optionally, you can adopt a racial quirk from the table below.
