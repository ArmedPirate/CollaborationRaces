# Collaboration Races
Monstrous and Other Popular Races made in Markdown

Goal: Be a general outline for popular races that people can look to to find consistency. The intent is for this to be THE resource for Centaurs, Saytrs, Race Reduxs for unpopular traits for monsters from Volo's and other popular races that have no standard elsewhere. 

This guide may expand to include variants for Vampire/Werewolf PCs, Undead PCs, and other monstrous afflictions that go against the norm player races hold to in the playable books. 

This will hopefully be a resource to point new players and veteran players to. The intent is to publish it for FREE on DMs guild with free for use and edit art that requires in attribution or uses the DM Guilds base art assets. 

This project is based in community feedback to bring out a large scale successful baseline for DMs to lean towards if they want to expand races out beyond the core PHB and possibly Volo's while adding options for players who want variety in the core existing races.

### Add New Races in New Files
Keep races sepparate for ease of read and development

### Keep Subraces Grouped in a File Containing Base Race
Allows ease of read and navigation for existing features

### Follow Common Formatting rules within base traits

### Conisder a Planar Race Guide
With Sigil heavily being hinted at as the next setting, creating a Planar Race guide could be fruitful. Consider core races and planar races seperately (examples being Modrons and Bladelings vs Centaurs and Bullywugs)
